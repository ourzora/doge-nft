# Jawn.fr

Personal Site. 

This gallery uses `@zoralabs/nft-components` to render custom auctions. Fork this to create your own curated auction house or galleries of Zora media or ERC721s.


#### Code structure:
- `lib/`: Constants and content
- `scss/`: Stylesheets
- `components/`: Components used for the site. Zora integrations are in `zora-card` and `doge-nft-card`.
- `scripts/`: Effect utils
- `public/`: Public assets
- `pages/`: Static next.js pages and server-side content fetching

#### How to make your own:
1. Update content and referenced NFTs in `lib/` and in `pages/`
2. Update styles in `scss/`
3. Publish! Next.js works well with vercel and netlify
